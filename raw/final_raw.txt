This is very bad experience regarding Covid-19 vaccination center today at PHC Bisrakh. My parents and relatives have been given appointment in forenoon to get vaccinated but reaching the vaccination center.They were told that centre is closed on Sunday.Why they booked today.
Covid# There is surge in number of positive cases surpassing United States andBrazilto name afew as per news paper. This mess has been created because of not enforcing safetymeasures and taking this excercise casually    because government is in election mood.
As COVID cases are rapidly increasing in India, many states have imposed night curfew & lockdown. Lockdown is not a solution to COVID-19. Instead wearing a mask in public and maintaining social distancing will help stop the spread of coronavirus.
A better & practical solution straight from Punjab to the cops: instead of punishment, give the COVID-19 restrictions offenders, a good dose of laxatives  They will stay at home alongside washing their hands more frequently!

India now has more active cases of the #COVID19 than at any other time since the beginning of the pandemic. The country's active case count is now an all-time high of around 10,46,000 on Friday, even as fresh cases surged to another new peak of over 1.45 lakh.
We are quick to go out and get agitated on how badly the government is prepared to handle Covid... It shocks me to see how little Indian middle class households are prepared for scenarios to quarantine a patient incase someone catches it in the family. 1/2

Keep in mind that COVID-19 isnâ€™t the only killer. By bringing the healthcare system to its knees, many people with treatable conditions are dying because theyâ€™re being denied care or are too afraid to go to hospital.

I had a phone conversation with a friend in the UK, where the govt has increased the gap for Covishield shots to 9 to 10 weeks. How illiterate these educated politicians are! Or, perhaps, they wish to indulge in politics.
"Vaccine Maitri/Diplomacy"  of exporting abt 64 mn doses  not a good idea, specially gift/grants of abt 10 mn doses. India sud've limited it's exports to the needs of  UN COVAX pgme & any other commitments made to UK (original maker of Covishield/Astra Zeneca).
The negative reports from Europe about Covishield are getting people worried and is becoming a major cause of vaccine hesitancy in some parts. My bro-in-law elected to get Covaxin when presented the choice and told me that most of his friends did the same.
Received my first dose of #Covishield (#AstraZeneca) at a Delhi Clinic where a MBE certificate is displayed in the lobby. This is certainly a good sign, isnâ€™t? The vaccination being approved by Her Majesty #TheQueen & #PrincePhilip.

Experts clear Russiaâ€™s Sputnik Covid-19 vaccine for use in India. India now has three approved Covid-19 vaccines - Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik-V.
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, if given approval by Indian regulators, will be the 3rd vaccine to be allowed in India after Covaxin, Covishield
Is it something like Covaxin is better than Covishield ?

In other words â€œfuck offâ€. We donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s just that trump wld have clearly said fuck off, without any political correctness. That is why it is covaxin that will pull india out of this pandemic, not covishield.
While #GOI has clearly messed up in #vaccine procurement, #INC is being unreasonable here. The global vaccine procurement is anything but equal. It simply cannot be. The new policy doesnâ€™t preclude GOI from continuing to procure #Covishield or #Covaxin at negotiated rates.

My daily reminder: Vaccination is essential! Of the 16 million-plus Indians who received full two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin, only about 0.004% have been infected by Covid. If youâ€™re eligible, please do register for vaccination. It may help to stop the next wave.

Covid -ve report, full vaccine dose must for candidates, agents to be in counting hall on May 2. Twin-dose vax rule means those 45-60 yrs & with no comorbidity who got Covishield will still need test report. No gatherings outside halls; every other agent must be in PPE gear

Let me know:"
Bullshit. Pfizer and moderna are not able to supply to Europe. Imagine supplying 100â€™s of millions of doses to India and distributing it with non-existent cold chain of -70. Stop spreading disinformation during this pandemic. We need to increase production of covaxin urgently.
Let the covax initiative fall apart. Who cares. Liberals have wet dreams of getting Pfizer and moderna vaccine. Thankfully we have a leader who understands global hypocrisy and diplomacy.
As soon as #Pfizer and #Moderna announced outcome of their #COVID19 #Vaccine trails , all developed countries like USA , UK , France , UAE , Israel etc placed orders in advance. India didnâ€™t place sufficient orders despite having 2 home made #vaccine  #Covaxine and #Covidshield
Even your boss had Pfizer in Itlay long back even than he had Corona. The Indian mutuan understands Covaxin the best.

"India must not take the 
@pfizer
 vaccine if they want GoI to waive their liability in case of negligence or want the latter to indemnify the former in case of Civil lawsuits arising from citizens. 1/n"
"Pfizer wanted liability exemption from side-effects. Pfizer refused to conduct mandatory bridge trial. Pfizer requires storage chain at -25Â°C that India lacks. Pfizer is demanding state assets as collateral in developing nations. Pfizer is spending huge money on PR

but but but 
He is questioning indian vaccine #Covaxin which is costing $8

"Why is this being amplified so much, isn't this misdirected? Correct me if im wrong. 
i) Pfizer had storage requirements not possible for india
ii) Needed more localised testing."
You can give me all the facts but all I wl chant is â€˜Pfizerâ€™, PFizer, PFIZER.
"So Pfizer at INR1500 is good and ok !

But Covishield and Covaxin at INR 600 is not ok !

People donâ€™t seem to appreciate this, but the U.S. scientists had already done years of work on SARS and MERS. So when Covid-19 struck, Fauci sprang into action and took a bold bet on mRNA technology â€” the same one powering the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Heâ€™s the father.

NDTV channel reported India vaccinated 4.3 mn in last 24h & currently India makes 70mn doses a month - this may go upto 110 mn doses a month soon as both COVISHIELD & COVAXIN boost production & Sputnik- V gets clearance. So far 83 mn Indians  vaccinated. We've a long way to go !
Chaotic scenes at the local vaccination centre. Crowd has come because COVAXIN is being administered. Seems people are wary of the blood clot reports in Covishield.

I had a phone conversation with a friend in the UK, where the govt has increased the gap for Covishield shots to 9 to 10 weeks. How illiterate these educated politicians are! Or, perhaps, they wish to indulge in politics.
"Vaccine Maitri/Diplomacy"  of exporting abt 64 mn doses  not a good idea, specially gift/grants of abt 10 mn doses. India sud've limited it's exports to the needs of  UN COVAX pgme & any other commitments made to UK (original maker of Covishield/Astra Zeneca).
The negative reports from Europe about Covishield are getting people worried and is becoming a major cause of vaccine hesitancy in some parts. My bro-in-law elected to get Covaxin when presented the choice and told me that most of his friends did the same.
Received my first dose of #Covishield (#AstraZeneca) at a Delhi Clinic where a MBE certificate is displayed in the lobby. This is certainly a good sign, isnâ€™t? The vaccination being approved by Her Majesty #TheQueen & #PrincePhilip.
"Most of the docs are aged between 50-55 years & took both doses of Covishield vaccine. Hospital authorities confirmed that the doctors received the second dose after a gap of 28 days.
Experts reiterate infection severity likely to be not severe since theyâ€™ve been vaccinated."

The DCGI has approved the restricted emergency use of the #SputnikV vaccine late Monday night. With this, India now has three vaccines against #COVID, including #Covishield and #Covaxin.
Over 1.67 crore #COVID19vaccine doses are still available with States and UTs, the Centre said on Tuesday, underlining that the problem is not of vaccine shortage but of better planning.

I have tried to summarize why to take #CovidVaccine  and try to break the myth about the reasons behind infections happening post vaccination. I hope people turn out in large numbers for Vaccination to protect our NATION #CoronavirusIndia #CovidIndia #Covaxin #Covishield #Corona
Out of 10,000 people who got vaccinated only 2 got #COVID19 in case of Covishield & 4 in case of Covaxin. Letâ€™s stop the debate on which 1 is better & these also had mild/moderate symptoms. Either 1 is better than the various strains of coronavirus. Get vaccinated India.
"Vaccination Works. Get Vaccinated.

Just 4 out of 10k people who were administered both doses of Covaxin and 3 out of 10k recipients of both doses of Covishield turned #COVID19 positive after inoculation."

What was the clarification on Covishield  all about then?
#Health is a #publicgood. #COVID is a worldwide calamity. #GovernmentofIndia must provide COVID vaccine free of cost to all.
Makes utmost sense. While SII didn't incur any R&D spend on developing Covishield, Bharat Biotech did its own R&D and invested a huge sum. Thus, a higher price makes a rational proposition.

Rs. 1200 is an absurd price to be selling covaxin to private hospitals. It was fine until 600 for covishield. Will definitely discourage EWS from getting vaccinated and thereby stopping this hell. #CovidIndia
The vaccine must be chargeable and why not? the companies spent thousands of crores in developing them only to sell them for free? ASK YOU GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THEM FREE not the companies. With this mindset it clearly shows why we are a 3rd world country. #Covaxin #Covishield

My daily reminder: Vaccination is essential! Of the 16 million-plus Indians who received full two doses of either Covishield or Covaxin, only about 0.004% have been infected by Covid. If youâ€™re eligible, please do register for vaccination. It may help to stop the next wave.
Regardless of whether Modi or SII are lying or not, it is important to know that the ban on the vaccine raw material export by US does not impact Covishield.

Germany fears AstraZeneca vaccine won't get EU approval for those over 65 -Bild http://reut.rs/3a2xSGC
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is not very effective for people over 65, German coalition sources told tabloid Bild and Handelsblatt, a step which calls into question its suitability in mass vaccination programmes.
"An incredibly dangerous cock-up if true !!!

""The AstraZeneca vaccine is allegedly hardly effective in older people. According to the German Handelsblatt newspaper, the drug has been found to have an effectiveness of only eight percent in people over 65."""
Handelsblatt story on AstraZeneca efficacy in over 65s is an unholy alliance between some of the least trusted professions
Worth noting: AstraZeneca looks confident it would stand up in court.
I bet this is not going to be on our news at all! Oxford, AstraZeneca vaccine only applied recently to the EMA to be patented in the #EU27 but allegedly will not pass the requirement as it has only 8% efficiency on people over 65. #Covid_19 #CovidVaccine #COVIDVaccination

We need to release our stockpile of unused AstraZeneca vaccines now. In India alone, almost 350,000 COVID-19 cases were reported today. When people in India and elsewhere desperately need help, we can't let vaccines sit in a warehouse, we need to get them where they'll save lives
It's heartbreaking watching the scenes from India, the whole World should unite to help them, and the Countries who've banned the Astra/Zeneca jab should pass them on to India, I'm sure those beleagured people wouldn't complain about a minor chance of blood clot!

"Reasons for optimism: 

- Pfizer will deliver 20 million doses between now and July 1st. 
- Moderna will deliver 6-7m doses between now and July 1. 
- AstraZeneca will deliver another 1.5m by July 1

Every adult will have one shot by Canada day."
