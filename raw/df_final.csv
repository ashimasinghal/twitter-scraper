May I present data from Israel?

About 55% of the population fully vaccinated

Infections are down more than 90% since peak

Pfizer and Moderna are the best vaccines. They have been out since Dec-2020. Why don't we have them in India yet? Do we not deserve the best? Don't we buy defense equipment from abroad?

Dear @PMOIndia. We MUST put second dose on hold, or at least increase the gap from 4 weeks to 12 like the UK has, so we can vaccinate as many as possible.

Lancet Covishield study: 81% efficacy if gap between doses is 12 weeks, 55% if gap < 6 weeks.

Save lives. AND Vaccines.
